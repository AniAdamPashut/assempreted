yes, this is shit af. but hey, first time writing cpp so i'll take it as a win. <br>

This language has 4 registers (yeah only 4) <br>
Those are the ax, bx, cx and dx registers <br>

This is not an emulator (although I might implement one later) <br>



## opcodes implemented:
- add, sub
- push, pop
- inc, dec
- jmp, je, cmp

## Shit I will hopefully implement:
- syscall
- call, ret
